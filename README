Experimental Fourier based collision detection and rigid body dynamics

This project is an application of some of the more concrete aspects of group 
morphology.  In this code, the non-penetration constraint for two rigid bodies
is modeled as a holonomic constraint on their configurations.  We generate such
a constraint by convolving the indicator functions of their respective sets
together.  Impulse response forces are computed by taking the gradient of this
convolution map.


Results of this research will appear in an upcoming paper.
